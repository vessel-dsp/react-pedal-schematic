Guidance for Claude Code and other coding agents working in this repository.

## Project

`@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic` is a React schematic editor library focused on **guitar effects pedals**. It provides format-aware import, parsing, validation, preview, inspection, light editing, and export for pedal electronics schematics and netlists. The broader audio-circuit surface — tube and solid-state amplifiers, hi-fi stages, eurorack modules, audio filters, mic preamps, and similar designs — can inform compatibility fixtures, but the product scope and first-class symbol work are pedal-first.

The library is consumer-agnostic. Any web application can embed it through a typed API; the library itself ships no opinions about how the host renders results or what downstream tooling consumes them.

Target formats:

- LiveSPICE `.schx` schematic XML (primary, graphical);
- LTspice `.asc` schematic (graphical, SYMBOL/WIRE/FLAG/IOPIN/TEXT);
- SPICE-style `.cir` / `.net` netlists (connectivity);
- project-native `.vdsp` Source format (strict `circuit-interchange/v1` YAML; LLM-friendly, schema name intentionally rename-safe);
- later KiCad schematic/netlist formats;
- later tscircuit / Circuit JSON interop for PCB and web preview workflows.

The library is not a real-time audio engine, not a SPICE simulator, not a wiring-diagram tool, and not a PCB fabrication tool. It produces reliable circuit documents and compatible schematic previews that other applications can consume.

## Distribution

The repo has two distinct deliverables that build from the same source tree:

- **Library** → npm as `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic`. Lives under `src/`. The package root is the React-friendly surface from `src/ui/index.tsx` plus core helper re-exports; `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic/core` maps to the headless `src/index.ts`; `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic/ui` remains a UI compatibility subpath. The library does not bundle a UI component framework; consumers bring their own styling.
- **Playground + docs site** → GitHub Pages. Lives under `playground/`. A Vite + React + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui SPA that imports the library directly from `src/` for development, demonstrates every supported format and component, and serves the reference documentation. Hosted at the project's GitHub Pages URL via a GitHub Actions deploy workflow.

The playground is the canonical demo and visual test surface. New features land in the library first, then get exercised in the playground.

## Scope Boundaries

Keep the first version small:

- Do import, parse, validate, preview, inspect, edit, and export audio circuit documents.
- Do not implement real-time audio DSP, signal simulation, or solver code.
- Do not implement a full SPICE solver in V1.
- Do not promise exact LiveSPICE, LTspice, KiCad, or tscircuit compatibility unless tested against fixtures.
- Do not use a generic graph editor as the canonical document model.
- Do not make tscircuit the source of truth. Use it as a preview/export target where it fits.

The canonical state is a library-owned circuit document model:

```text
source file (.schx / .cir / etc.)
  -> parsed source-specific AST
  -> normalized circuit document model
  -> editor operations
  -> optional serialized Source `.vdsp` view
  -> preview/export adapters
```

## `.vdsp` Interchange Format

The project-owned `.vdsp` format is the YAML Source view for `.schx`, `.asc`, `.cir`, `.net`, and future formats. It lets users inspect and lightly edit the normalized document through one explicit representation. Treat `circuit-preview-ir` as a project codename only. Do not bake that codename into the saved schema identity because the project may be renamed. Keep using a neutral versioned schema id such as `circuit-interchange/v1`.

The in-memory source of truth remains `CircuitDocument`; `.vdsp` is a serialized, LLM-friendly YAML wrapper around that model plus source metadata. It should be easy for humans and LLMs to read, diff, inspect, edit, and discuss.

Current implementation status:

- `src/formats/interchange/serializer.ts` exports `serializeInterchangeYaml(doc, options)` through the headless API.
- `src/formats/interchange/parser.ts` exports `parseInterchangeYaml(source)` through the headless API. It is a strict parser for the project serializer's YAML subset, not a general YAML import surface.
- `src/formats/document.ts` exports `.vdsp` helpers: `parseVdspCircuitDocument`, `serializeVdspCircuitDocument`, `parseCircuitDocumentFile`, `detectCircuitDocumentFileFormat`, and filename helpers.
- The playground top tab row includes **Source**, which shows the current edited `CircuitDocument` as copyable generated text. Its format dropdown defaults to `.vdsp` and can switch to `.schx` or `.cir`.
- The previous **Raw .schx** tab was removed; Source is now the single copy/paste conversion surface.
- The YAML view uses `schema: circuit-interchange/v1`, `metadata`, `source`, `components`, explicit terminal `node` ids, top-level `nodes`, `wires`, `directives`, `diagnostics`, and `rawAttributes`.
- `tests/formats/interchange/fixture-coverage.test.ts` verifies current serialization coverage across all supported fixtures in the workspace.
- `tests/formats/interchange/parser.test.ts` verifies the strict YAML parser can rebuild a `CircuitDocument` from the project's own serialized shape and preserves string-valued scalar properties.
- The parser ignores the derived top-level `nodes` block when rebuilding `CircuitDocument`; connectivity is recomputed from component terminals and wires.

Current format shape:

- Stable schema field: `schema: "circuit-interchange/v1"`.
- Stable ids for components, wires, terminals, nodes, and diagnostics.
- Explicit nodes: every component terminal includes its resolved node id; a top-level `nodes` list records names, ground role, aliases, and member pins.
- Typed quantities: preserve `{ raw, value, unit }` rather than flattening values into strings.
- Source provenance: record original format, filename when available, and encoding when relevant under `source`.
- Diagnostics: warnings and known lossy conversions are first-class data, not comments.

Do not use compact tuple-heavy data for the persisted interchange format. Prefer self-describing objects like `{ "x": 120, "y": 80 }` over `[120, 80]`, and `{ "componentId": "R1", "terminalName": "a" }` over `"R1:a"` except in derived indexes.

`.vdsp` is an inspection/edit/export artifact, not the canonical model and not a source-format round-trip path. Do not add source-format regeneration or cross-format conversion requirements unless the user explicitly reopens that scope. If future target-format exporters are added, they should consume `CircuitDocument` directly, with `.vdsp` used as an audit/debug/source-edit view.

```text
.schx / .asc / .cir / .net
  -> CircuitDocument
  -> .vdsp
  -> CircuitDocument (strict Source editor parser only)
```

## Audio-Domain Component Coverage

The component model and symbol library prioritize parts that show up in real audio schematics. Treat the following as first-class, not "specialty":

- **Passives**: resistors, capacitors (electrolytic / film / ceramic distinctions), inductors, potentiometers (audio/log + linear tapers), trimpots, variable resistors.
- **Semiconductors**: diodes (clipping, signal, Zener, LED), BJTs (general-purpose, low-noise), JFETs, MOSFETs, photoresistors / vactrols / optocouplers.
- **Tubes**: triodes (12AX7, 12AU7, etc.), pentodes, rectifier tubes, tube diodes.
- **ICs**: op-amps (single / dual / quad packages), audio op-amps (TL07x, NE5532, OPAxxx), comparators, voltage regulators, OTAs, BBDs, switched-cap chips, DSP/codec ICs marked as opaque.
- **Magnetics**: audio transformers (input/output/interstage), chokes, gyrators where used.
- **Mechanical / IO**: input/output jacks (TS, TRS, XLR), footswitches (SPST/SPDT/3PDT/4PDT — true bypass patterns matter), toggle switches, rotary switches, relays.
- **Sources / references**: voltage rails, ground variants (signal/chassis), batteries, power supplies, bias references.
- **View-only metadata**: labels, named wires, ports, test points, diagnostics.

For each component the library tracks: terminal layout, rotation/flip behavior, properties with parsed quantities and units, taper/curve metadata for controls, and a `support` level (`simulatable` vs `view-only`) so downstream tools know what is safe to act on. Unsupported components stay visible and are explicitly marked, never silently dropped.

## Pedal Symbol Strategy

The editor supports schematic preview as its visual surface: abstract electrical symbols, redrawn in a clean common pedal-schematic convention and backed by the normalized circuit document.

Wiring diagrams are out of scope. Do not add physical pedal-wiring symbols, lug-grid layouts, board-pad graphics, offboard wire endpoints, or a separate wiring-view renderer unless the product scope is explicitly reopened.

Symbol work is fixture-driven. Before broad redraw work, collect a component/symbol inventory from the bundled guitar-pedal schematics and use it as the acceptance target. The current pedal fixture corpus mostly needs:

- resistor, capacitor, electrolytic capacitor, inductor;
- diode, LED, Zener where present;
- BJT, JFET, MOSFET;
- op-amp / ideal op-amp;
- potentiometer, variable resistor;
- input jack, output jack, DC/battery supply, voltage rail, ground;
- SPDT and 3PDT/footswitch-style switches;
- label, named wire, port/test point metadata.

Wah-style filters are not a single schematic symbol. Represent them as normal components — inductor, pot, capacitors, resistors, transistor stages — and optionally annotate the related components with role metadata such as `role: "wah-filter"` for inspection surfaces.

Do not base the project symbol plan on downloaded generic EDA symbol packs. A KiCad reference-pack attempt was removed because it was not a good enough match for common guitar-pedal schematic notation. Prefer a small hand-redrawn, pedal-focused symbol set derived from observed pedal fixtures, common published pedal schematics, and an explicit project-native style guide. Terminal geometry comes from the component catalog/source format mapping, not from copied symbol artwork.

## Format Strategy

### `.schx`

Treat LiveSPICE `.schx` as the highest-priority graphical schematic format.

Support:

- XML import/export;
- symbols/components;
- positions, rotations, flips;
- terminals and wires;
- named wires and labels;
- component properties and values;
- warnings for unsupported or view-only components.

Do not silently drop unknown `.schx` data. Preserve unknown attributes where practical, and warn when round-tripping may lose information.

Audio-engine runtime descriptors (`Circuit.MicroBlock*`, `Circuit.MacroTremolo`, `Circuit.MacroPhaser`) are recognized as opaque `kind: "ic"` runtime descriptors, not physical chips. Non-stage descriptors use terminals `input`/`output`, stable `sourceTypeName: "Circuit.<ShortType>"`, `RuntimeDescriptor: "true"`, and a `runtime-descriptor-imported` warning. Existing `MicroBlock*Stage` descriptors keep their legacy `in`/`out` terminals but also carry runtime descriptor metadata. Stereo fields such as `StereoOutputMode` stay component properties; do not synthesize extra schematic jacks unless the source schematic contains them.

### `.cir` / `.net`

Treat SPICE netlists as connectivity-first documents, not graphical schematics.

Support V1 parsing for:

- comments and directives;
- resistors, capacitors, inductors;
- diodes, BJTs, JFETs, MOSFETs as typed components;
- voltage and current sources;
- `.model`, `.subckt`, `.ends`, `.include`, `.param` as preserved metadata where full handling is not implemented.

V1 preview can auto-layout imported netlists, but exported netlists must preserve electrical connectivity and original model/directive text where possible.

### `.asc` (LTspice)

Treat LTspice `.asc` as the second graphical schematic format, alongside `.schx`.

Support:

- line-oriented parsing for `SYMBOL`, `WIRE`, `FLAG`, `IOPIN`, `TEXT`, and `SYMATTR` records;
- symbol catalog mapping LTspice symbol names → normalized `ComponentKind` with terminal geometry (`src/formats/ltspice/catalog.ts`);
- orientation strings (`R0..R270`, `M0..M270`) → our `{ rotation, flipped }` tuple;
- `FLAG` markers for ground/named nets and `IOPIN` markers for input/output jacks;
- `WIRE` records into the same wire-splitting pipeline as `.schx`;
- unknown symbol types fall back to `kind: 'unsupported'` with `sourceTypeName: "ltspice:<symbol>"` so they round-trip visibly.

Surface unsupported keywords (`WINDOW`, `LINE`, `RECTANGLE`, etc.) as warnings, not silent drops.

### Interchangeability Review

Current conversion and Source `.vdsp` confidence by format:

| Format | Import status | Export status | Source `.vdsp` / conversion notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.schx` LiveSPICE | Implemented for graphical symbols, wires, labels, rotations/flips, properties, root attributes | Implemented | Best current round-trip target. Risk remains around unknown element internals and unsupported source-specific component data. |
| `.asc` LTspice | Implemented for common schematic records and catalogued symbols | Not yet implemented | Import can preserve semantic layout, but ignored drawing records and missing `.asy` pin geometry can make strict round-trip impossible until an ASC serializer and symbol-file support exist. |
| `.cir` / `.net` SPICE | Implemented for flat common primitives and preserved directives | Implemented through `toNetlistView()` | Connectivity-first only. Comments, original ordering details, unsupported subcircuit instances, and graphical layout are lossy. |
| `.vdsp` | Strict `circuit-interchange/v1` YAML parser implemented for the project's serialized shape | `CircuitDocument -> .vdsp` serialization implemented | Current fixtures serialize to `.vdsp` for Source-tab coverage. `.vdsp` edits can rebuild `CircuitDocument`, but this is not source-format regeneration. |

Cross-format conversion rules:

- `.schx` ↔ `.asc`: target semantic schematic interchange, but do not promise exact visual or source-file round-trip until both serializers and fixture baselines exist. LTspice symbol-path models and LiveSPICE component `_Type` values need explicit source metadata.
- Graphical formats (`.schx`, `.asc`) → `.cir` / `.net`: preserve electrical connectivity, component values, models, and directives where supported. Expect loss of layout, labels that are not electrical nets, unsupported view-only components, and source-specific visual metadata.
- `.cir` / `.net` → graphical formats: generate deterministic layout and preserve connectivity, but mark the layout as synthesized. Never imply that a generated schematic is the original drawing.
- Any format → `.vdsp`: this is an inspection/edit path for `CircuitDocument`. Do not require `.vdsp -> source format` or `.vdsp -> other format`.
- Cross-format conversion, if implemented later, should go through `CircuitDocument` and target-specific serializers directly, not through YAML as a source-format bridge.

### Multi-format dispatcher

`src/formats/document.ts` exposes:

- `CircuitFormat = 'schx' | 'spice' | 'ltspice-asc'`;
- `detectCircuitFormat(filename)` — extension-based;
- `parseCircuitDocument(source, { format?, filename? })` — single entrypoint that delegates to the right parser.

Use the dispatcher in playground / consumer code rather than calling format-specific parsers directly, so adding a new format only needs a new branch in one place.

The strict YAML serializer/parser lives under `src/formats/interchange/`; the project-owned file format helpers in `src/formats/document.ts` expose that shape as `.vdsp`. Keep source-format dispatch (`.schx`, `.asc`, `.cir`, `.net`) separate from `.vdsp` document-file dispatch.

### Fixture Corpus Strategy

Fixture coverage is the acceptance target for parser compatibility, source-format export where supported, and Source `.vdsp` coverage. Collect fixtures by format and by purpose:

- **Minimal fixtures**: small hand-written circuits that isolate one parser feature or edge case.
- **Real pedal fixtures**: complete guitar-pedal schematics that exercise common audio components and naming conventions.
- **Stress fixtures**: larger amp, tone-stack, filter, and utility circuits that reveal compatibility gaps without shifting product scope away from pedals.
- **Round-trip baselines**: expected parse → serialize → parse invariants for source formats that support export.
- **Source `.vdsp` baselines**: source → `CircuitDocument` → `.vdsp` checks, plus focused `.vdsp` → `CircuitDocument` parser checks. Coverage should focus on explicit node ids, component kind, terminal names, values, models, directives, diagnostics, and string-valued scalar properties.

Every external fixture corpus must include provenance next to the files: source URL, license, date vendored, encoding if non-UTF-8, known unsupported symbols/components, and why the corpus matters. Do not add downloaded generic EDA symbol packs as fixture substitutes; fixture files should represent real circuits or targeted parser cases.

Current and target fixture organization:

- `tests/fixtures/schx/`: hand-written LiveSPICE fixtures plus the vendored upstream LiveSPICE example corpus.
- `tests/fixtures/asc/`: small LTspice fixtures; accepted pedal corpora should live under named subdirectories such as `ltspice-guitar-pedals/` with a README/provenance file.
- `tests/fixtures/cir/`: hand-written SPICE fixtures; needs larger pedal-style `.cir` / `.net` examples with `.model`, `.subckt`, `.include`, and parameter coverage.
- Future `tests/fixtures/interchange/`: optional expected `.vdsp` YAML snapshots or focused examples for the Source tab and strict parser.

Fixture tests should cover five layers:

1. Parser smoke: every vendored fixture parses without crashes.
2. Unsupported inventory: unknown symbols/components are either fixed or explicitly allowlisted.
3. Same-format round-trip: component counts, wire counts, terminal names, values, directives, and resolved nodes remain stable.
4. Source `.vdsp` coverage: source → `CircuitDocument` → `.vdsp` succeeds for every supported fixture, with no unresolved terminal nodes; focused parser tests cover `.vdsp` → `CircuitDocument`.
5. Cross-format semantics: only needed for future target serializers; do not route this through YAML import.

Current interchange coverage satisfies broad serialization coverage for layer 4, and focused parser tests cover the editable Source `.vdsp` path. Add more parser fixtures only when new YAML shapes or edge cases are introduced.

### tscircuit

Use tscircuit as a preview and interop target for web-friendly board/schematic rendering, not as the canonical editor model.

Prefer standalone preview generation first:

- built-in tscircuit elements only for generated previews;
- CDN/browser preview where appropriate;
- no package dependency unless there is a clear local build or test need.

Mark unsupported source components as comments or warnings instead of pretending they are supported.

## Architecture

Use TypeScript for both the library and the playground. Use Bun for scripts and tests. Use Vite for the playground dev server and GH Pages build.

Preferred module boundaries:

### Library (`src/`)

- `src/formats/document.ts`: cross-format entry — `CircuitFormat`, `detectCircuitFormat(filename)`, `parseCircuitDocument(source, options)`.
- `src/formats/schx/*`: `.schx` parser, serializer, type mapping, fixture tests.
- `src/formats/ltspice/*`: `.asc` parser, symbol catalog, terminal mapping, fixture tests.
- `src/formats/spice/*`: `.cir` / `.net` lexer/parser, serializer, directive preservation, fixture tests.
- `src/formats/interchange/*`: LLM-friendly intermediary YAML serializer/parser and fixture coverage tests.
- `src/model/*`: normalized circuit document model, component/terminal/wire/node types, validation.
- `src/components/*`: pedal/audio component catalog — terminal maps, property schemas, taper curves, and schematic symbol metadata.
- `src/editor/*`: editor commands such as add, move, rotate, flip, connect, delete, rename, edit property.
- `src/preview/*`: SVG schematic preview, fixture-driven symbol inventory, tscircuit preview/export, auto-layout for netlists.
- `src/ui/*`: optional React component subpath. Ships UI primitives that render the model (canvas, palette, inspector). These must not depend on shadcn/ui or any specific design system — consumers bring their own styling.
- `src/index.ts`: public headless API — formats, model, editor, component catalog.
- `src/ui/index.tsx`: public React component API.
- `tests/fixtures/*`: real-world audio circuit fixtures (`.schx`, `.asc`, `.cir`, `.net`) plus provenance notes and round-trip/interchange baselines.

Keep parsing and transformation code independent of React. The headless entrypoint must work without pulling in the UI layer so that headless consumers (build tools, validators, exporters, server-side renderers) can use the library directly.

### Playground + docs (`playground/`)

- `playground/index.html`, `playground/src/main.tsx`: Vite entrypoint.
- `playground/src/App.tsx`: top-level shell — playground and docs surfaces.
- `playground/src/components/ui/*`: shadcn/ui components copied in by the shadcn CLI (project-owned source).
- `playground/src/lib/utils.ts`: `cn()` helper and other playground-scoped utilities.
- `playground/src/index.css`: Tailwind v4 entry + theme tokens.
- `playground/src/pages/*`: playground views (import circuit, inspect, preview) and docs pages.

The playground imports the library through Vite path aliases (`@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic`, `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic/core`, `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic/ui`) so changes to `src/` are picked up live during development.

## UI Rules

- Build an actual editor surface, not a marketing page.
- Use a dense, practical circuit-tool layout.
- Do not use React Flow as the canonical circuit editor.
- Use a custom SVG or canvas schematic surface backed by the normalized circuit model.
- The current generic boxed component renderer is a temporary inspection renderer. The future schematic view should use common schematic symbols without generic boxes for supported components, while still keeping selection affordances and clear unsupported-component markers.
- Start with selection, inspector, import/export, warnings, and preview before adding advanced editing.
- Keep unsupported components visible and explicitly marked.
- Editing must not silently change circuit behavior.
- Use **shadcn/ui** for all playground and docs UI chrome (buttons, dialogs, tabs, cards, command palette, etc.). Install via the shadcn CLI; treat the copied component sources as project-owned and edit freely.
- The library's `src/ui/*` does *not* depend on shadcn/ui. Keep it stylable from the outside via class hooks or render-prop slots so consumers can theme it with their own design system.

## Development Rules

- Use `rg` for search.
- Use Bun commands, not npm, unless the user explicitly asks.
- Keep format parsers covered by fixture tests before expanding UI behavior.
- Add new format support as adapters around the normalized model, not as one-off UI paths.
- Preserve source fidelity first; clever normalization comes after round-trip tests exist.
- Treat the interchange YAML as a serialized Source/export/edit adapter around `CircuitDocument`, not as a second in-memory canonical model and not as a source-format round-trip mechanism.
- Never silently perform lossy format conversion. Emit diagnostics for unsupported components, synthesized layout, dropped directives, ignored source graphics, and missing serializer support.
- Keep the headless library boundary clean — `src/index.ts` and everything it transitively imports must not depend on React.
- New components are added to `src/components/*` with terminal maps, property schemas, symbol metadata, and at least one fixture that exercises them.

## Verification

Pick the smallest check that covers the change:

- Parser/serializer changes: run the related fixture and round-trip tests.
- Interchange changes: run interchange serializer/parser tests and the broad fixture YAML coverage test.
- Model/editor command changes: run unit tests for command behavior.
- Component catalog changes: run catalog unit tests + any fixture that uses the component.
- UI changes: run TypeScript/web checks and inspect the local browser view when feasible.
- Docs-only changes: inspect the changed file.

## PLAN

Status: planned

### Phase 0: Project Scaffold

Goal: create the library project + the GH Pages playground with strict TypeScript, a runnable test setup, working dev server, and clear module boundaries.

Library tasks:

- [x] Create `~/Projects/circuit-preview-editor`.
- [x] Add `CLAUDE.md`.
- [x] Symlink `AGENTS.md` to `CLAUDE.md`.
- [x] Initialize `package.json` (Bun + TypeScript strict + `bun test`).
- [x] Add `tsconfig.json` (strict, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, exactOptionalPropertyTypes, verbatimModuleSyntax) and `tsconfig.build.json` for library emit.
- [x] Set up dual entrypoints: `src/index.ts` (headless) and `src/ui/index.tsx` (React).
- [x] Wire scripts: `bun test`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run build`, `bun run clean`.

Playground tasks:

- [x] Install Vite + React + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui prerequisites.
- [x] Create `playground/` (Vite root) with `index.html`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/index.css`.
- [x] Add `vite.config.ts` with React + Tailwind plugins, `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic` / `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic/core` / `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic/ui` path aliases to `src/`, GH Pages `base` path, and `outDir` → `gh-pages/`.
- [x] Add `components.json` and a Tailwind v4 + shadcn token CSS (`playground/src/index.css`); `cn()` helper at `playground/src/lib/utils.ts`.
- [x] Single shared `tsconfig.json` covers library + tests + playground via `paths` aliases; build config stays in `tsconfig.build.json`.
- [x] Add scripts: `bun run dev`, `bun run build:playground`, `bun run preview`.
- [x] Hello-world `App.tsx` renders the library's `VERSION` and the shadcn `Button` to prove the alias and shadcn-ui pipeline work.
- [x] Add `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that builds the playground and deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main`.

Success criteria:

- `bun install && bun test && bun run typecheck` succeed on a clean checkout.
- The headless entrypoint compiles and imports nothing from `src/ui/*` or React.
- `bun run dev` starts the Vite playground and renders a shadcn-styled hello page that imports from the library via its package alias.
- `bun run build:playground` emits a static site under `gh-pages/`.
- Scope, audio-domain focus, format separation, and distribution targets are documented in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Phase 1: Core Circuit Model

Goal: define a small normalized circuit document model expressive enough for audio schematics from both graphical and netlist sources.

Tasks:

- [x] Define component, terminal, wire, point, and warning types (`src/model/types.ts`). Directive and source-location types deferred until the format parsers need them.
- [x] Define `ParsedQuantity` with unit tags and a `parseQuantity()` parser (`src/model/quantity.ts`) covering SI prefixes, `Ω`/`ohm`/`F`/`H`/`V`/`A`/`W`/`Hz`/`s`, and scientific notation.
- [x] Implement **Borrow #1** — union-find pin → node resolution (`src/model/connectivity.ts`): `resolveConnectivity()` returns `{ pinToNode, nodeMembers, groundNodeId, nodeCount }`. Reimplemented from textbook union-find; CircuitSetu (GPL-3.0) referenced for the "ground → node 0" convention only.
- [x] Unit tests cover quantity parsing (15 cases) and connectivity (9 cases: empty doc, dangling resistor, wire-joined Rs, RC divider with ground, multi-ground unification, wire chain, coincident pins, multi-terminal op-amp, pinKey stability).
- [ ] Control metadata (taper curves, ranges, default values) → moved to Phase 2 since it's catalog-specific.

Success criteria:

- The model can represent a simple RC filter and a single-transistor gain stage from both `.schx` and `.cir` imports.
- The model has zero React or DOM dependencies.
- `resolveConnectivity()` correctly identifies nodes in fixtures including ground unification and multi-terminal components.

### Phase 2: Audio Component Catalog

Goal: ship a first-class catalog of audio-circuit components with symbols, terminals, and property schemas.

Tasks:

- [x] Implement **Borrow #3** — validation rules + property schemas (`src/model/validation.ts`): `PropertyRule` discriminated union (`quantity` with optional unit/min/max, or `string`), per-kind rule tables for 17 audio-domain kinds, `validateDocument()`, `validateComponent()`, `getRulesForKind()`, `hasErrors()`. 8 stable `ValidationCode`s (`value-required`, `model-required`, `value-unparseable`, `value-out-of-range`, `unit-mismatch`, `unsupported-component`, `duplicate-id`, `degenerate-wire`). 29 unit tests cover required values, alias resolution, range bounds (R=0/-100/2.2G all rejected), unit-mismatch warnings, semiconductor model requirements, duplicate IDs, degenerate wires, and view-only skip. Rules currently live as static lookup tables and will fold into the catalog entries when this phase lands.
- [ ] Define component definitions for the audio-domain coverage list above (passives, semiconductors, tubes, op-amps, transformers, switches, jacks, sources, view-only).
- [ ] Provide SVG symbol primitives that can be reused by the preview layer.
- [ ] Resolve terminal positions per component, including rotation/flip transforms.
- [ ] Distinguish `simulatable` vs `view-only` support per component.
- [ ] Add catalog unit tests (every catalog entry round-trips its terminals; quantity props parse).
- [ ] Migrate the inline lookup tables in `src/model/netlist.ts` (SPICE letter, node order, value property, has-model) and `src/model/validation.ts` (rules) into per-kind catalog entries.
- [ ] Add control metadata (taper curves, ranges, default values) for potentiometers, switches, and variable resistors.

Success criteria:

- A standard guitar-pedal palette (R, C, pot, BJT, JFET, op-amp, diode, footswitch, jack, ground) is available from the headless API.
- Each catalog entry documents its terminals, taper/curve metadata where applicable, and support level.

### Phase 3: `.schx` Import / Export

Goal: support LiveSPICE-style schematic documents with round-trip fidelity for audio circuits.

Tasks:

- [x] Build `.schx` XML parser (`src/formats/schx/parser.ts`). Regex-based (no XML-parser dependency); handles attribute ordering, whitespace, comments, UTF-8 BOM, malformed wires (warn + skip), unknown component types (warn + retain `sourceTypeName` + kind `'unsupported'`), and unique-id collision via `name-N` suffixing.
- [x] Build `.schx` serializer (`src/formats/schx/serializer.ts`). Emits well-formed XML with proper entity escaping, reconstructs the LiveSPICE `_Type` via the catalog when `sourceTypeName` is missing, and round-trips `Name`/`Description`/`PartNumber` plus all extra root attributes.
- [x] Preserve positions, rotations, flips, raw attributes, wires, named wires, and labels. Negative LiveSPICE rotations (e.g. `-1`) normalize to `0..3`. Unparseable quantity values (e.g. `Impedance="∞ Ω"`) fall back to string storage so they round-trip verbatim.
- [x] Map `.schx` element types to the audio component catalog (`src/formats/schx/catalog.ts`) — 36 entries covering passives, semis (incl. canonical `BipolarJunctionTransistor`), tubes, op-amps, transformers, switches/SPDT/SP3T/SP4T, sources, ground/rail, jacks (Input/Speaker), labels, named wires.
- [x] Recognize audio-engine runtime descriptors (`Circuit.MicroBlock*`, `Circuit.MacroTremolo`, `Circuit.MacroPhaser`) as opaque ICs with stable source names, runtime diagnostics, and `input`/`output` terminal geometry for non-stage descriptors.
- [x] Add focused fixture round-trip tests (`tests/fixtures/schx/`) for `passive-divider`, `passive-lowpass`, and `lpb-1-style-boost`. Round-trip asserts component count, wire count, kind, name, origin, rotation, flip, and terminal count are stable. Connectivity + netlist projection also exercised end-to-end on the fixtures.
- [x] Vendor and test the upstream LiveSPICE example corpus under `tests/fixtures/schx/livespice-examples/` with provenance in README. Tests assert every expected `.schx` is present, parses without unknown component type warnings, covers real pedal/amp examples including op-amps and JFETs, and round-trips with stable component/wire counts.
- [ ] Add additional focused minimal fixtures only when a broad example does not isolate the behavior being changed, especially diode clippers, tube triodes, switches, labels/named wires, and source-specific unknown-data preservation.

Success criteria:

- Each fixture imports and exports without material topology loss.
- Unknown attributes are preserved or explicitly surfaced in warnings.

### Phase 4: `.cir` / SPICE Netlist Import + Export

Goal: parse common SPICE netlists into the normalized model and round-trip them out, without pretending to be a full SPICE clone.

Tasks:

- [x] Implement **Borrow #2** — flat netlist projection (`src/model/netlist.ts`): `toNetlistView()` returns `{ components: NetlistComponent[], nodeCount, groundNodeId, directives, warnings }`. Per-kind SPICE letters, node-order conventions (R/C/L → a/b; D → anode/cathode; Q → C/B/E; J → D/G/S; M → D/G/S/B; V/I → +/-), and model-name extraction live as inline lookup tables.
- [x] Build a line-oriented SPICE parser (`src/formats/spice/parser.ts`): comment + continuation handling, R/C/L/D/Q/J/M/V/I rules, multi-line `.SUBCKT` blocks preserved verbatim, `.TITLE` → metadata.name, `.END` terminator, inline `;` comments stripped. Subcircuit instances (`X`) emit a warning. Synthesizes wires + an auto-`GND` component at node "0" via a star topology so the result is renderable through `resolveConnectivity()`.
- [x] Write a SPICE serializer (`src/formats/spice/serializer.ts`) consuming `toNetlistView()`. Subckt-bound kinds emit as commented placeholders. Directives passed through verbatim. 22 unit tests cover parse, serialize, and round-trip.
- [x] Added `directives: readonly string[]` to `CircuitDocument` so `.MODEL`/`.SUBCKT`/`.INCLUDE`/`.PARAM` blocks survive parse → serialize cycles unchanged.
- [ ] Round-trip tests against larger published `.cir` / `.net` fixtures — current coverage is two hand-written fixtures. Prioritize pedal-style circuits with `.model`, `.subckt`, `.include`, `.param`, op-amp/macromodel, transistor, clipping diode, and tone-stack coverage.

Success criteria:

- A simple pedal-style `.cir` fixture (e.g. one-transistor gain stage with a `.model`) imports with correct nodes/components and the `.model` block survives a re-export.
- Unsupported directives are visible in diagnostics and preserved where practical.

### Phase 4b: LTspice `.asc` Import

Goal: parse common LTspice schematic files into the same normalized circuit document, side-by-side with `.schx`.

Tasks:

- [x] Line-oriented `.asc` parser (`src/formats/ltspice/parser.ts`). Tokenizes `SYMBOL` / `WIRE` / `FLAG` / `IOPIN` / `TEXT` / `SYMATTR` records, ignores `WINDOW` / `LINE` / `RECTANGLE` / etc. (with warnings), and runs the parsed wire set through `splitWiresAtJunctions` so junction semantics match `.schx`.
- [x] LTspice symbol catalog (`src/formats/ltspice/catalog.ts`): maps LTspice symbol names → normalized `ComponentKind`, declares terminal layout per symbol, and provides `mapLtspiceTerminal()` + orientation handling (`R0..R270`, `M0..M270` → `rotation`/`flipped`).
- [x] `IOPIN In|Out` markers register as `kind: 'jack'` with `sourceTypeName` `ltspice:InputJack` / `ltspice:OutputJack`; preview symbols distinguish input vs output jacks.
- [x] LED is a first-class `ComponentKind`; `.schx` Diodes with `Type="led"` and LTspice LED symbols both map there. Dedicated `led.svg` preview symbol.
- [x] Unified entrypoint via `parseCircuitDocument(...)` in `src/formats/document.ts`. Extension detection: `.asc` → `'ltspice-asc'`.
- [x] Fixture: `tests/fixtures/asc/simple-rc.asc` covers the IOPIN + WIRE + SYMBOL path end-to-end through parser + SchematicView SSR rendering tests.
- [ ] Accept and document a real LTspice guitar-pedal corpus under `tests/fixtures/asc/ltspice-guitar-pedals/` with source URL, license, encoding, known unsupported symbols, and parser tests. The corpus should cover BJT, JFET, op-amp, wah, compressor, distortion, and tone-control schematics.
- [ ] Add focused `.asc` fixtures for parser edge cases that large pedal schematics obscure: custom symbol paths, Windows-1252 bytes such as `µ`, missing `SYMATTR`, mirrored rotations, multi-point labels, flags, and IOPIN polarity.
- [ ] Add an `.asc` *serializer* so edits round-trip back to LTspice — currently import-only.

Success criteria:

- A pedal-style LTspice `.asc` (input/output jacks, ground, R/C/L, diode/BJT) imports with correct components, wires, and electrical nodes.
- Unknown LTspice symbols surface as `unsupported` with `sourceTypeName` preserved, never silently dropped.

### Phase 4c: Editable `.vdsp` Source + Fixture Matrix

Goal: define the project-native `.vdsp` Source view that turns any parsed `CircuitDocument` from `.schx`, `.asc`, `.cir`, `.net`, and future formats into an explicit, LLM-friendly YAML representation, and allows strict `circuit-interchange/v1` edits to rebuild `CircuitDocument`. Back-conversion to source/fixture formats is not required.

Tasks:

- [ ] Define `src/formats/interchange/types.ts` for a versioned YAML shape with metadata, components, terminals, explicit nodes, wires, directives, source provenance, and diagnostics.
- [x] Add YAML serialization with a persisted schema id that does not depend on the temporary `circuit-preview-ir` codename.
- [x] Implement first-pass `CircuitDocument -> interchange YAML` serialization with explicit node ids derived from `resolveConnectivity()` (`serializeInterchangeYaml`).
- [x] Implement strict `interchange YAML -> CircuitDocument` parsing for the project's own serialized shape (`parseInterchangeYaml`).
- [x] Show copyable generated source text in the playground **Source** tab from the current edited `CircuitDocument`, with a format selector that defaults to `.vdsp` and can switch to `.schx` or `.cir`.
- [x] Remove the separate Raw `.schx` tab so Source is the single copy/paste conversion surface.
- [ ] Add focused YAML output tests for edge cases: unsupported components, parser diagnostics, named wires/labels, source metadata, directives, unitless quantities, and string-valued properties that are not parseable quantities.
- [x] Add focused YAML parser tests for metadata edits, components, terminals, wires, schema rejection, and numeric-looking scalar properties.
- [x] Add broad fixture serialization coverage: every supported fixture currently visible under `tests/fixtures` serializes to interchange YAML without unresolved terminal nodes.
- [ ] Add fixture provenance checks so external fixture directories cannot be added without README/source/license/encoding notes.

Success criteria:

- `.vdsp` represents every current `CircuitDocument` field needed for LLM inspection plus derived nodes and source metadata.
- Every supported fixture can be serialized to `.vdsp` with stable schema id, component data, wire data, diagnostics, and no unresolved terminal nodes.
- The playground Source tab reflects the current edited document, not only the original fixture text, and can show copyable `.schx`, `.vdsp`, or `.cir` output.
- There is no requirement to convert `.vdsp` back to `.schx`, `.asc`, `.cir`, `.net`, or any fixture source format.

### Phase 5: Preview Surface

Goal: make imported pedal circuits understandable before full editing exists, with a schematic preview surface:

- **Schematic**: common pedal/electronics abstract circuit symbols for electrical reasoning.

Tasks:

- [x] Add SVG schematic preview. `src/preview/symbols.ts` provides framework-agnostic symbol data (per-kind `Primitive[]` in local coords) covering 26 `ComponentKind`s; `src/preview/bounds.ts` computes the document viewBox with fallback + padding; `src/ui/schematic.tsx` exposes `<SchematicView document={...} />` that renders wires + components via `currentColor` so consumers can theme it.
- [x] Mark unsupported/view-only components in the preview with explicit styling — unsupported kinds render with reduced opacity + dashed strokes via `stroke-dasharray`.
- [x] Wire the playground to load bundled fixtures (`playground/src/fixtures/*.schx` via `?raw` imports), render them in a shadcn-styled shell (`Card` / `Tabs` / `Select` / `Badge`), and expose four tabs: Schematic, Netlist (table of `NetlistView` rows), Warnings (parser + validation + netlist diagnostics), Raw `.schx`.
- [x] **Boxy renderer (CircuitSetu-style frame).** Each component is wrapped in a rounded `<rect>` (`src/preview/box-layout.ts`, `HALF_SIZE=11`, `PAD=0`). Symbol primitives shrunk significantly (resistor body 22×32 → 10×14; BJT/JFET circle r=14 → r=7; op-amp triangle 56×44 → 21×20; port symbols r=18 → r=7; pot body 22×32 → 10×14) so leads dominate visually and connectors land exactly on box edges. Filled connector dots are drawn at every terminal world position. Component name labels sit below the box (outside) with a halo for readability.
- [x] **Pan + zoom.** SVG viewBox is state-managed inside `SchematicView`. Mousewheel zooms anchored at the cursor (clamped to `[0.1×, 10×]` of initial bounds). Drag on empty canvas pans (3 px threshold separates "click to deselect" from "drag to pan"). `userSelect: none` + `touchAction: none` on the SVG so drags don't trigger text selection or touch scroll.
- [x] **Orthogonal wire routing** (`src/preview/routing.ts`). Each wire renders as a `<polyline>`: straight 2-point path for axis-aligned wires, single-elbow L-shape for diagonal wires (horizontal-first when `|dx| ≥ |dy|`, vertical-first otherwise).
- [x] **Junction dots** (`src/preview/junctions.ts`). `findJunctions(wires, terminals)` flags any wire endpoint that sits on another wire's middle (T-junction) or any endpoint shared by ≥3 wires (Y/X-junction); terminal positions are excluded since the terminal dots already mark them. Rendered as small filled circles on top of components.
- [x] **Wire splitting at T-junctions** (`src/model/wires.ts`, `splitWiresAtJunctions`). Called by every parser (`parseSchx`, `parseLtspiceAsc`) after wire collection. Any wire whose middle is touched by another wire's endpoint is split into shorter segments at the junction point. Result: every electrical junction is at a real wire endpoint, so when a component is dragged only the segments that actually touch its terminals move, and the junction stays put. Original `passive-divider` has 10 wires → 13 after splitting (one split on the horizontal R1→O1 trunk, two splits on the ground rail).
- [x] **Runtime wire splitting at terminal positions** (`src/preview/renderable-wires.ts`, `buildRenderableWires`). On every render, `SchematicView` re-derives the displayed wire set by additionally splitting wires wherever a component terminal lands on a wire body — including positions that are only reached after a drag. This is what keeps a terminal-on-wire-middle case (e.g. drag a component so its pin lands on a trunk) visually and electrically T-junction-correct without committing extra wires to the model.
- [x] **Inferred junction dots** (`src/preview/junctions.ts`). In addition to wire-endpoint T- and Y/X-junctions, `findJunctions` now flags any *component terminal* that lands on the middle of a wire — so editor-induced junctions render a dot the moment the user drops a component onto a wire.
- [x] **SVG symbol library refactor** (`src/preview/symbols/`). Per-kind symbol artwork now lives as standalone `.svg` files (`resistor.svg`, `bjt-npn.svg`, `bjt-pnp.svg`, `capacitor.svg`, `capacitor-electrolytic.svg`, `diode.svg`, `diode-zener.svg`, `led.svg`, `jfet-n.svg`, `jfet-p.svg`, `mosfet-n.svg`, `mosfet-p.svg`, `triode.svg`, `pentode.svg`, `tube-diode.svg`, `transformer.svg`, `opamp.svg`, `ic-block.svg`, `optocoupler.svg`, `photoresistor.svg`, `potentiometer.svg`, `variable-resistor.svg`, `switch-spst.svg`, `switch-spdt.svg`, `switch-3pdt.svg`, `switch-toggle.svg`, `switch-rotary.svg`, `relay.svg`, `inductor.svg`, `battery.svg`, `voltage-source.svg`, `current-source.svg`, `rail.svg`, `ground.svg`, `jack-input.svg`, `jack-output.svg`, `port.svg`, `named-wire.svg`, `label.svg`, `unsupported.svg`). `svg-content.ts` exposes them as inlineable `<g>` markup so the renderer can place them into the schematic surface alongside the box frame. Inline `Primitive[]` shapes in `src/preview/symbols.ts` are still used by the boxed inspection view; the SVG files are the source of truth for the schematic preview surface.
- [x] First-pass LTspice input/output jack rendering and LED support are now driven by the SVG library and the `led` `ComponentKind`.
- [ ] Add a fixture-driven **guitar-pedal symbol inventory** report/test. It should scan bundled pedal fixtures, count observed source component types/kinds, and fail when an observed pedal symbol lacks a schematic-view plan.
- [ ] Replace the temporary generic boxed schematic glyphs for supported pedal components with a hand-redrawn project-native schematic symbol set. Start from the observed pedal inventory and common guitar-pedal schematics: R, C, electrolytic C, inductor, diode, LED, BJT, JFET, MOSFET, op-amp, potentiometer, variable resistor, input/output jack, rail, ground, battery/DC source, SPDT/3PDT/footswitch, label/named wire/test point.
- [ ] Treat wah filters as a recognized subcircuit/role annotation, not as a monolithic component. Keep the schematic as inductor + pot + R/C/transistor network.
- [ ] Add simple auto-layout preview for netlist-only imports — waits for Phase 4 `.cir` parser.
- [ ] Add tscircuit preview/export adapter for the subset of the catalog that maps cleanly.
- [ ] Expand op-amp / diode-clipper / tube-triode fixtures so the playground exercises every catalog branch.

Success criteria:

- `.schx` circuits render using their source geometry.
- `.cir` circuits render with deterministic generated layout.
- Every observed guitar-pedal fixture symbol has an explicit schematic symbol strategy.
- tscircuit preview is clearly labeled as a preview/export target and skips unmapped components with warnings.
- The deployed GH Pages playground shows working previews of all bundled fixtures.

### Phase 6: Minimal Editing

Goal: implement useful editing without expanding into a full EDA suite.

The playground has two modes:
- **Preview** (default): non-interactive (read-only) — click only selects. Future iteration will add an auto-sort/auto-layout pass for `.cir`-imported docs.
- **Edit**: free-form. Components can be placed anywhere by drag-and-drop. Wires stay where they are (not auto-routed).

Tasks:

- [x] `src/editor/commands.ts` — pure `applyDocumentCommand(doc, command)` reducer. Commands: `delete-component`, `rename-component`, `set-property` (auto-`parseQuantity` when prior value was a quantity), `remove-property`, `move-component` (shifts terminals by the delta AND rewrites any wire endpoint that matches an old terminal position, so wires follow the dragged component).
- [x] `src/editor/history.ts` — `EditorState = { document, selectedId, past, future }` + `applyEditorCommand` with select / undo / redo / pass-through. History capped at 200 entries. Deleting the selected component clears selection.
- [x] `SchematicView` accepts `editMode`, `selectedId`, `onSelect`, `onMoveComponent`, `snapTo` (default 10), `snapRadius` (default 12), `minZoom` / `maxZoom`. Pointer events handle click-to-select, background-click-to-deselect, drag-to-move (with pointer capture). Selected components get a thicker outline. While dragging, wires connected to the dragged component re-route in real time and a snap target indicator appears when a dragged terminal comes within `snapRadius` of another component's terminal (`src/preview/snap.ts` — `findSnap` picks the closest target and adjusts the candidate origin so the terminals coincide exactly).
- [x] Playground mode toggle (Preview / Edit) + Undo / Redo / Delete buttons + selection info bar. Editor state reducer mounted with a `key={fixtureId}` so switching fixtures resets the history.
- [x] **Inspector panel** (`playground/src/components/inspector.tsx`). 320-px right column on `lg` screens, stacked on mobile. Shows the selected component's id (header) + kind (badge), editable name (commits on blur / Enter), read-only meta chips (origin, rotation, terminal count, source type), per-property `<Input>` row with parsed `value + unit` subtitle, `×` remove button per property, and a destructive Delete button. All edit affordances disabled in Preview mode. Built with shadcn `Input` / `Label` / `Separator`.
- [x] **Connectivity correctness**: `resolveConnectivity` now unions wire endpoints with the wires they sit on mid-segment, so T-junctions are electrically merged even when one side is dragged into a diagonal. Combined with `splitWiresAtJunctions` at parse time, every junction stays self-consistent through edits.
- [x] **BJT emitter catalog fix**: LiveSPICE places the NPN/PNP emitter at local `(+10, -20)` (slanted), not `(0, -20)`. Catalog + symbol primitives updated. Without this, Q1.emitter in the LPB-1 fixture was an electrically floating pin.
- [x] **Fixture-level connectivity tests** (`tests/formats/schx/connectivity.test.ts`): per-fixture assertions for node counts, ground anchoring, and which terminals share each electrical node (passive-divider: 5 cases; passive-lowpass: 3; lpb-1-style-boost: 7 including the BJT bias junction, collector load, emitter group, output coupling, and pot wiper).
- [x] **SVG rendering tests** (`tests/ui/schematic.test.tsx`): SSR `SchematicView` via `react-dom/server` and assert the expected polyline points + junction dots are in the markup.
- [ ] Graphical rotate / flip commands.
- [ ] Wire create / delete in edit mode.
- [ ] Preview-mode auto-layout pass — sort/organize components into a clean schematic from arbitrary positions. Deferred as a larger refactor.
- [ ] Serialize edits back to `.schx` and warn when an edit doesn't round-trip cleanly.

Success criteria:

- A user can import a `.schx`, move/edit components, export it, and re-import it without topology loss.
- Netlist imports can be inspected and edited conservatively without losing original directives.

### Phase 7: Library Packaging & Public API

Goal: publish a clean, typed, consumer-friendly library that other web apps can embed.

Tasks:

- [x] Lock the public surface as package root `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic` (React UI + core helper re-exports), `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic/core` (headless parsers/model/editor/preview helpers), and `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic/ui` (React UI compatibility subpath).
- [x] Verify the headless entrypoint has no React dependency through `tests/smoke.test.ts`.
- [x] Produce ESM + type declaration build output suitable for npm publishing via `tsconfig.build.json`.
- [x] Declare `react` / `react-dom` as peer dependencies for the React UI surface.
- [x] Add npm publish readiness metadata: public package name `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic`, `files`, `main`/`module`/`types`, export map, `publishConfig`, `prepack`, and `pack:dry-run`.

Success criteria:

- A web app can install the library and use the headless API through `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic/core` without React in its bundle.
- A React web app can import `SchematicView` and common helpers from `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic`, or keep using the `@vessel-dsp/react-pedal-schematic/ui` subpath.
- The build output is reproducible, typechecked, tested, and packable with `npm pack --dry-run`.
